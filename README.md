# Sweet Shop Management System - Complete Setup Guide

This project implements a full-stack Sweet Shop Management System

## Quick Start

**Demo Accounts:**
- Admin: `admin@sweetshop.com` / `admin123`
- User: `user@sweetshop.com` / `user123`

### Clone the Project and move to sweet_shop directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saiashu12/Sweet_Shop_Management.git

cd sweet_shop
```

### Backend (For External Deployment)
The backend folder contains a complete Node.js/Express API that you can deploy separately:

**Navigate to backend directory:**
```bash
cd backend
```

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

**Run in development:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Now run frontend
```bash
cd frontend
```
## Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
## Run the project

```bash
npm start
```

Now the project will run in localhost:3000

### My AI Usage

As per project requirements, I leveraged AI responsibly throughout development:

## Tools Used:

ChatGPT (for debugging guidance, generating boilerplate, and test examples)

GitHub Copilot (inline code suggestions, function autocompletion)

## How I Used Them:

Brainstormed API structures and test cases with ChatGPT.

Generated initial controller/service scaffolding with Copilot.

Asked ChatGPT for explanations and code review suggestions when refining logic.

## Reflection:
AI tools improved my productivity by reducing boilerplate time and helping me focus on logic and testing. However, I ensured that every AI-generated snippet was understood, reviewed, and refactored before committing. This allowed me to maintain full ownership of the project while benefiting from AI acceleration.
